## Setting up droplets, load balancer, and firewalls
<p>
    For the purpose of this assignment you will need to create two droplets and connect a load balancer to both of them, as well as a firewall. The setting up of the droplets, load balancer, and firewall won't be covered here because it is extensively covered in these videos:

[Load Balancer and Firewall Setup](https://vimeo.com/775412708/4a219b37e7)
    
At this point you should have both your droplets created(with ssh for regular users and root login blocked), and the load balancer and firewall connected to both of them. Your project home page should look something like this:
